# CSS-Position-Property

By setting postion property of .move-me and its parent-element's .section-2, and also that of .section-1, I can learn how the different values of position property works:
e.g

.move-me    .section-2
===========================
fixed
fixed       relative
fixed       fixed
fixed       absolute
absolute
absolute     relative
...           ...
